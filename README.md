## The aim
This project focuses on the analysis of four Selection methods of Genetic Algorithms, namely:

- Fitness Proportionate Selection,  

- Rank Selection,

- Tournament Selection,

- Truncation Selection.

Performances and computational costs are compared when using different data structures.
