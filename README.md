## The aim
This project focuses on the analysis of four Selection methods of Genetic Algorithms, namely:

- Fitness Proportionate Selection,  

- Rank Selection,

- Tournament Selection,

- Truncation Selection.

In particular, performances and computational costs ared compared when using two different data structures.
